;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements a thin Emacs front-end to a small program
;; called `osd_cat', written by Martijn van de Streek
;; <martijn@foodfight.org>.  That program in turn is a front-end to
;; the X OSD Library, a cool piece of software for overlaying text on
;; an X display written by Andre Renaud <andre@ignavus.net>.  While
;; I'm dropping names, I might as well mention Tim Wright
;; <tim@ignavus.net>, the current maintainer of the X OSD Library, who
;; apparently also made significant contributions to the
;; aforementioned `osd_cat'.

;; Presumably, an Emacs front-end to an X OSD library is useful in any
;; situation where the user needs or wants to be informed of something
;; regardless of whether or not their eyes are currently focused on an
;; Emacs frame.  The reason I wrote it because I thought it would be
;; neat to have the artist's name and title of the song pop up
;; whenever EMMS starts playing something new.

;; EMMS, by the way, is the Emacs Multi-Media System created by Jorgen
;; Schaefer <forcer@forcix.cx> and Ulrik Jensen <terryp@daimi.au.dk>,
;; inspired by an earlier music player front-end for Emacs called
;; `mp3player'.  For more information, see
;; <http://www.gnu.org/software/emms>.

;;; Instructions:

;; First of all, you will probably want to put this file somewhere
;; Emacs looks, most likely `~/.elisp/', and add the following line to
;; your `.emacs':

;;  (require 'osd)

;; To get the basic functionality working, you have to download and
;; install the X OSD Library and the `osd_cat' utility if you don't
;; already have them.  You can get these packages from, for instance,
;;  - the web (<http://www.ignavus.net/>),
;;  - Debian's APT (`xosd-bin' and `libxosd2'), or
;;  - Gentoo's Portage (`x11-libs/xosd').

;; For neat EMMS integration, try this:

;;  (add-hook 'emms-player-start-hook
;;            (lambda () (osd-broadcast-string
;;                        (emms-playlist-get-current))

;; If you think the on-screen text looks a little boring, try using
;; the following settings instead of the defaults.  These are designed
;; to match the Zenburn color theme, which can be found at
;; <http://www.deepwood.net/software/zenburn/zenburn.el>.

;;  (setq osd-program-args
;;        '("--pos"          "top"
;;          "--offset"       "30"
;;          "--align"        "center"
;;          "--delay"        "3"
;;          "--color"        "#dcdccc"
;;          "--outline"      "1"
;;          "--shadow"       "3"
;;          "--shadowcolour" "#1e2320"
;;          "--font"
;;          "-*-new century schoolbook-bold-i-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"))

;;; Wishlist:

;; Add more use cases.  This will also reveal any missing
;; functionality.  Drop me a line if you have any ideas about ways to
;; use this module.

;; Perhaps make the arguments to `osd_cat' customizable in a more
;; user-friendly manner.
